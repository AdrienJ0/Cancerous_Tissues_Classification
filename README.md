# Classification_Cancerous_Tissues

## Context

As part of our Master 1 in AI at the engineering school ISEN Lille, we developed a Machine Learning system dedicated to the classification of cancerous tissue images. More specifically, the objective was to implement and train a powerful Machine Learning system able to classify, from the biopsies of a given patient, the subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (ABC or GCB) that he has.

## Project progress

This project was carried out in 02 main phases:

### The writing of a state of the art (see the file "State of the art.pdf")

This phase was purely theoretical. It consisted of researching all the existing information concerning the resolution of our problem in order to establish a clear strategy to carry out our project.

### The implementation of the strategy (see the file "Final Report.pdf")

This phase was mainly practical. It was about applying the strategy established during the first phase.
